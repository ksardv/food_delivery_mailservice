1. docker config - having to set the IP everytime after installation - why?
I removed the network the docker created and simply used localhost
2. rabbitmq implementation
3. services fallback
4. unit tests

I started with first testing the default laravel queue and check how it works. It was deffinately not the way my rabbotmq implementaion worked.
I installed a rabibitmq library for laravel and set the confg files and functionality accordingly. Removed the extra consumer publisher and worker classes and the console commands.
Since lumen does not have form requests I could not take out the request validation out and ha to leave it with rules, but still it changed a bit.
Then I changes the way I save the Email in the database - it was crappy - just one field.
Then I wanted to trigger an event when an emai lis created call the listener (which implements the ShouldQueue) to be sure to grab the event.
I added new statuses created and processing to distinguish between stages. I must also add the final status from the 3rd party APIs when I check them.
I added logging to make sure every time an email is created it is being logged (needs further refinement).
I then did not like the way the different email providers were being integrated. I changed the email service provider. Set a new service to select a mail provider and
based on it ot bind the Gateway Interface to the proper Adapter. I decided to go with adapeter pattern since it is dealing with 3rd party providers which have different implementation
but same functionality.
Then I got to unit testing.
What needs to be done is integrate cypress in the frontend and do more unit tests and further refine my mail adapters.

rename vendors to mailclients - options to be callable?
